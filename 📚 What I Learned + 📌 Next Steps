📚 What I Learned

Using #ifdef _WIN32 for cross-platform conditional compilation.

Correct random seeding (srand(time(NULL))) to ensure varied bot moves.

Handling user input safely and skipping invalid rounds.

📌 Next Steps

Let player choose number of rounds.

Add score history.

Maybe extend to “Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock” 😄
